**Word Search**

Welcome to Phoenix Word Search!!!

Here you can challenge your brain by playing word search.

You can choose from three levels -- easy, medium, and hard.

When you find a word, replace all the letters of the word in the word search with an asterisk [*].

Then press the check button to see if you've found a word!

If time is running out or you are desperate, you can replace a single letter with an asterisk and if that letter is in any of the words, it will turn lowercase.

Bonus! All three word searches have a theme of phoenixes and fire!

If you change a letter that's not part of a word to an asterisk, then when 
the word search resets, it will change to a different random letter. 

Don't get confused!

When you're ready, click the 'home page' button to return to the home screen and start your puzzle!

Can you beat the clock and solve them all?

The level files are level1.txt, level2.txt, and level3.txt.
